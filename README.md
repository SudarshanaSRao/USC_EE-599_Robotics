## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and evaluation of a quadrupedal robot that uses a bounding gait optimized for navigating deformable terrains. The primary objective is to investigate the critical locomotion parameter, phase overlap/difference, and how it affects the robot's stability and propulsive efficiency. This research aims to advance robotic capabilities in challenging environments, such as search and rescue missions and extraterrestrial exploration, where traditional wheeled or tracked systems face limitations.

## Key Features
- **Quadrupedal Design**: The robot is designed with four legs, employing a bounding gait for high mobility and speed over deformable and challenging surfaces.
- **Phase Overlap Optimization**: The robot's locomotion is controlled by adjusting the phase overlap/difference, a key parameter in bounding gaits. The study investigates the optimal phase overlap for maximizing velocity while maintaining stability.
- **Real-World Application**: The robot is intended to be adaptable to real-world scenarios such as rescue missions and planetary exploration, where terrain is often unpredictable and deformable.
- **Buehler Clock Parameters**: The robot's locomotion is modeled and optimized using the Buehler clock, a set of parameters that describe leg movement synchronization.

## Research Highlights
- **Velocity and Phase Overlap**: Through empirical experimentation, it was demonstrated that the robot's velocity increases to an optimal point with phase overlap before it begins to decrease. This highlights the importance of phase overlap in balancing stability and propulsion.
- **Stability and Efficiency**: The research identifies the optimal phase overlap that ensures both stability and high propulsive efficiency, key for successful traversal of deformable terrains.
- **Adaptive Locomotion**: The study provides new insights into the adaptive locomotion of quadrupedal robots, contributing to future design improvements.

## Components
- **Robot Hardware**: Custom-built quadrupedal robot equipped with actuators, sensors, and necessary electronic components for locomotion control and stability assessment.
- **Software**: The control system leverages algorithms to adjust phase overlap and optimize gait for varying terrain conditions. This includes both hardware and simulation environments for testing.
- **Simulation Environment**: A computational model is used to simulate different terrain types and adjust locomotion parameters to test the robot's performance under controlled conditions before real-world trials.
